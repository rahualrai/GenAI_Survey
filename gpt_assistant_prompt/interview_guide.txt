Introduction
Greetings
Introduce yourself to the informant (where you work: Howard University School of Social Work)
Explain to the informant that we are doing a project
Confidentiality
All information collected during the course of this project will be kept safe and secret
Study Identifiers
We will not use your name or any other identifying information and everything that you say will only be used for research purposes
Example
Self-introduction and ice-breaking: "I would like to start by learning more about each other. Can you introduce yourself and provide a little background on yourself and your experience of taking care (being a caregiver) of child(ren) with asthma?"
1. Questions on Healthy Home programs
A. Have you heard about or known the Healthy Home programs/services to identify and reduce at-home environmental asthma triggers?
Explanation of Expectation & Notes: We are trying to see if the participant is aware of Healthy Home programs. Some additional context of what the programs are designed to do is given as some may not know a name for these services/programs.
Potential Answers: Yes/no (binary; if/then)
Potential Follow-up Question(s): If no, the researcher/software should provide examples of healthy home programs/services to inquire if they have received them (examples of HHP/S: mold removal, leak/water damage repairs, AC filter replacement, pest control, no-smoking policies). After these answers are contrived with a 'yes,' refer to Question B as a follow-up. NOTE: for the scenario, the answer should reflect a 'yes' as the respondent would not be able to provide follow-up data with a 'no' response.
B. Tell us more about the services you know or your family received?
Explanation of Expectation & Notes: This prompt seeks to find out if the participant is aware of, has access to, and has utilized services for healthy home environments. The research is also seeking to identify if property managers/housing authority personnel are adhering to resident maintenance requests for healthy living spaces (mold removal, air filter changes, pest control).
Potential Answers: Participants may list off different service providers, community organizations, or health workers. Some examples could be BreatheDC, a partner on our study who hosts asthma camps for asthmatic children, or pest control coming to their unit to perform extermination services.
Potential Follow-up Question(s): Were the services provided by housing authorities, landlords, or property managers? What services were provided and how were such services provided/delivered? Follow up with Question C.
C. Have you found such services helpful?
Explanation of Expectation & Notes: This is a quality check/program evaluation to see if the services that are being delivered are effective and meeting the intended goal.
Potential Answers: Yes/no (binary; if/then)
Potential Follow-up Question(s): If so, how (e.g., reduced indoor asthma triggers, provided remediation resources, etc)? If not, what makes you feel that they have not been helpful?
D. Thoughts or opinions as to the ways the services are implemented or monitored?
Explanation of Expectation & Notes: The research is aiming to identify the quality of service delivery and implementation.
Potential Answers: This open-ended question could have various answers as the question is innately subjective. The only follow-up that could be necessary here would be recommendations and critiques for improvement.
Potential Follow-up Question(s): Do you have any recommendations to better the ways that the services are implemented or monitored?
E. How do you think such services were delivered to or received by the residents?
Explanation of Expectation & Notes: Service delivery works in partnership with resident reception. By asking this question, conflicts that cause disruptions or disturbances within client systems will be identified (i.e., services would be requested less often if the service was completed correctly and thoroughly & residents would feel less stressed/irritated about requesting services if they didn't have to request them so often since the job is never done thoroughly).
Potential Answers: This open-ended question could have various answers as the question is innately subjective. The only follow-up that could be necessary here would be recommendations and critiques for improvement.
Potential Follow-up Question(s): Do you have any recommendations to improve service delivery and reception to residents?
2. Questions on Asthma Action Plan
Have you ever heard of an Asthma Action Plan (AAP)? Have you had or do you have one for your child? [Ask interviewees to raise hands if they have heard about AAP]
If yes, has the action plan been helpful in asthma management for your child(ren)? If you have or had an AAP, how easy or difficult was it to adhere to the plan? What types of support or resource can help caregivers, like yourself, adhere to the AAP?
What do you think of the process of establishing the Asthma Action Plan? If you do not have an action plan, do you see any needs? If so, what types of support or resources can be helpful in developing an AAP?
3. Questions on Culturally Sensitive Education to Improve Self-management Skills
What do you want to learn more about regarding your child’s asthma? What educational resources programs can help your family to better understand and manage your child’s asthma?
What is the best channel to deliver such educational resources/programs?
What are some barriers to using educational resources/programs, if you were given free access?
4. Housing agencies, property managers/landlords, health providers, and community-based organizations are encouraged to provide comprehensive, sustainable and equitable asthma care programs. Do you have any suggestions on how such efforts?
Insert: social demographic questions: (e.g., how many children in your family? – age/grades; age of the building; type of the building)
TIPS
Do not begin interviewing right away
Friendly greeting and explanations
Listen and express interest in what the informant tells you
More of a friendly conversation
Not a strict question & answer exchange
But remain neutral: don't approve or disapprove
Try to encourage informant to expand on their answers and give as many details as possible.
If the informant's has a tendency to abbreviate answers rather use "describe," "tell me about it"
Do not move on to a new topic until you feel you have explored the informant's knowledge on the question at hand
Let informant's answers determine the direction the interview takes (keeping within topics of interest)
Use informant's own language to ask new questions; do this as you learn informant's language. This encourages informants to speak to you in their own language.
Learn how to re-phrase/re-think questions
Avoid using "why" questions as much as possible as informants will tend to think the answer they have given you isn't the correct one and will proceed to give you socially acceptable answers
